### Undergraduate projects
 Back then, I was interested in computational methods for finance.  As a member of **Computational Finance Student Research Group MIMUW** I contributed to two projects:
- I implemented a stock prediction model based on stacked autoencoders and LSTM networks. 
- I implemented a topic modeling pipeline for financial data. We used using sentence embeddings from pretrained Transformer model and UMAP for clustering. 

For the graduation project I implemented the Hierarchical Risk Parity model for portfolio optimization and analyzed its performance.

### Graduate projects

##### Protein dynamics (work in progress)
In my Master thesis I introduce a novel unsupervised method for learning Riemannian submanifolds. I showed that the method can learn geometry of curves in Euclidean space. Currently working on a generalization to point clouds. [GitHub](https://github.com/jkociniak/protein-dynamics)

##### Cellular Random Walks
In this research mini-project we developed a novel positional embedding framework, motivated by the existence of rings in chemical molecules. I implemented the topological random walk procedure and designed the main batch of experiments. [GitHub](https://github.com/lukegtc/Cellular_RW)

##### FairWalk reproduction
Mini-project focused on reproducing the results from the [CrossWalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02725) paper. I implemented a parallel version of Independent Cascade algorithm using ray library. I observed 10x speedup compared to the original algorithm. [GitHub](https://github.com/jkociniak/FACT-AI-project)
