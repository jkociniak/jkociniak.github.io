AI researcher and engineer.

I am a 2nd year student of **MSc Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Amsterdam**. During my studies I have been focused on modeling complex data and AI for natural sciences, such as chemistry.

Currently, I am researching geometric deep learning approaches for modeling protein dynamics under the supervision of [Willem Diepeveen](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/wd292) (Cambridge Image Analysis Group) and [Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io/) (AMLab UvA).

My ultimate goal is to make sure that future AI algorithms are

- simple and interpretable,
- theoretically grounded,
- compute-efficient and sample-efficient.

Besides academia, I worked in data analyst, ML & research roles in multiple startups.

### My interests

- AI for physics, chemistry, biology, robotics;
- AI for 2D and 3D graphics, videos and animations;
- AI for computer vision, object tracking, pose estimation;
- Analysis of temporal data, with a focus on spatiotemporal data;
- Analysis of structured data, with a focus on graphs;
- Geometric & topological deep learning;
- Unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning;
- Dimensionality reduction, manifold learning;
- Expressivity of deep learning models.

### Background

I graduated with a **BSc Computer Science** degree from the **University of Warsaw** in 2020. Back then, I was interested in computational methods for finance. I implemented a deep learning model for stock prediction as a mini-project in **Computational Finance Research Group MIMUW**. For the graduation project I implemented the Hierarchical Risk Parity model for portfolio optimization and analyzed its performance.

In parallel I finished all coursework for **BSc Mathematics** at the **University of Warsaw**. I set out for an ambitious thesis project about deep learning in hyperbolic spaces, but finally dropped out due to burnout. I consider this experience as a valuable lesson and foundational step for my current research efforts.

During my studies I have worked as a mathematical programmer for the **National Centre for Nuclear Research**, as a part of [Interdisciplinary Division for Energy Analyses](https://idea.edu.pl/). I'm thankful for the opportunity to gain my initial research experience and hone my numerical analysis and optimization skills there.

### Projects

[Protein dynamics (work in progress)](https://github.com/jkociniak/protein-dynamics): In my thesis I introduce a novel unsupervised method for learning Riemannian submanifolds. I showed that the method can learn geometry of curves in Euclidean space. Currently working on a generalization to point clouds.

[Cellular Random Walks](https://github.com/lukegtc/Cellular_RW): In this research mini-project we developed a novel positional embedding framework, motivated by existence of rings in chemical molecules. Implemented the topological random walk procedure and designed the main batch of experiments.

[FairWalk](https://github.com/jkociniak/FACT-AI-project): Mini-project focused on reproducing the results from CrossWalk paper. Implemented a parallel version of Independent Cascade algorithm using ray library. Observed 10x speedup compared to the original algorithm.
