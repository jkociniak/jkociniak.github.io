AI researcher and engineer.

I am a 2nd year student of **MSc Artificial Intelligence** at the **University of Amsterdam**. My interests revolve around geometrical and topological deep learning, with applications to natural sciences and computer vision.

Currently, I am developing a deep learning model for learning latent Riemannian geometry of high-dimensional point clouds under the supervision of [Willem Diepeveen](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/wd292) (**Cambridge Image Analysis Group, now UCLA**) and [Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io/) (**Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab**).

My ultimate goal is to make sure that future AI algorithms are

- leveraging appropriate inductive biases,
- theoretically grounded,
- compute-efficient and sample-efficient.

Besides academia, I worked in data analyst, ML & research roles in multiple startups.

I am an experienced Python coder, but I feel comfortable with JavaScript, C, C++, Java and Haskell. In future projects I would like to hone my C/C++ skills and lean into more efficiency-oriented projects. I would also like to learn more about diffusion models and generative approaches in general.

### My interests

- AI for drug design, computational chemistry and structural biology;
- AI for natural sciences;
- AI for computer vision, object tracking, pose estimation;
- AI for 2D and 3D graphics, videos and animations;
- Analysis of temporal data, with a focus on spatiotemporal data;
- Analysis of structured data, with a focus on graphs;
- Geometric & topological deep learning;
- Unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning;
- Dimensionality reduction, manifold learning;
- Expressivity of deep learning models.
- Multimodal models, 

### Background

My first serious achievement was obtaining a laureate title in **LXVIII Polish Mathematical Olympiad** in 2017.

I graduated with a **BSc Computer Science** degree from the **University of Warsaw** in 2020.

In parallel, I finished all coursework for **BSc Mathematics** at the **University of Warsaw**. I set out for an ambitious thesis project about deep learning in hyperbolic spaces, but finally dropped out due to burnout. I consider this experience a valuable lesson and a foundational step for my current research efforts. I learned that research is much harder than simply being good at textbook problems :) 

During my studies I have worked as a mathematical programmer for the **National Centre for Nuclear Research**, as a part of **Interdisciplinary Division for Energy Analyses**. I'm thankful for the opportunity to assist in research projects and hone my numerical analysis and optimization skills there.

At **SOLVEMED** and **New Security Systems** I gained invaluable experience in building cutting-edge computer vision solutions, including object detection & tracking, pose estimation and video analysis.

At **Banacha Street** I ran a pilot project aiming for analysis of geofencing data. I extracted and validated device trajectories from raw data, then prepared interactive visualisations for clients.
